Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Crude Birth Rate:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Crude birth rate (CBR) refers to the number of live-births to the population in the year per thousand population.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gross Reproduction Rate:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gross reproduction rate refers to the number of daughters a woman would have under the following assumptions: (i) that she experiences the age-specific fertility rates prevailing during the reference period (ii) that she is assumed to have survived to the end of her childbearing years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Live-Births:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data on live-births cover live births occurring within Singapore and its territorial waters. These births are registered under the Registration of Births and Deaths Act (Chapter 267).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Net Reproduction Rate:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Net reproduction rate is a refinement of the gross reproduction rate, and is also the measure of replacement of population. It refers to the number of daughters a woman would have under the following assumptions: (i) she experiences the age-specific fertility rate prevailing during the reference period (ii) she experiences the age-specific mortality rate prevailing during the reference period",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Total Fertility Rate:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Total fertility rate refers to the average number of live-births each female would have during her reproductive years if she were subject to the prevailing age-specific fertility rates in the population in the given year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
